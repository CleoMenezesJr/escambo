## 🏗️ Build

#### We need the following resources:

#### Clone, build and run:

Clone the latest Escambo source from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/escambo.git
```

Enter the directory and build

```bash
cd escambo
flatpak-builder build io.github.cleomenezesjr.Escambo.json --user --install --force-clean
```

Run

```bash
cd escambo
flatpak run io.github.cleomenezesjr.Escambo
```

That's it!

## ⌨️ I want to contribute!

That's great!

Here are some basic rules to get you started:
Commits should start with a Capital letter and should be written in present tense (e.g. **:tada: Add cool new feature** instead of **:tada: Added cool new feature**).
You should also start your commit message with **one** applicable emoji.
This does not only look great but also makes you rethink what to add to a commit. Make many but small commits!

## I want to create a pot file!

You can use this command to create a pot file for translation:

`xgettext --files-from=po/POTFILES --output=po/escambo.pot --from-code=UTF-8 --add-comments --keyword=_ --keyword=C_:1c,2`

## 🔄 Why "Escambo"

> Escambo, in general, means exchange or barter.
> In the history of colonial Brazil, however, the term appears frequently associated with the type of relations established between the Portuguese and the indigenous people in the first decades of the 16th century.

[Wikipedia](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escambo)

The name is an allusion to the exchange mechanism that allows communication between the application and other external systems.
With affection, I want to start giving more meaning to the culture and history of Brazil through my apps.
